                    <p><em>I think I'm going to miss you for the rest of my life.</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>Mostly when I can't sleep, or eat,</p>
                    <p>or really every time, when I'm trying to find,<br>
                    a reason this all happened—</p>
                    <p>So I recall a time when you were mine.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>Like the Tuesday you told me your dad left when you were nine.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>Seems like no one in your life ever learned to stay,<br>
                    so was it funny when I said,</p>
                    <p><em>"I'm not going anywhere,"</em></p>
                    <p>Like I had a say.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>I didn't know your love was like a bet you'd win anyway—</p>
                    <p>You were taught to leave before I even learned to pray.<br>
                    So I thought, that maybe this time,<br>
                    just this one time,<br>
                    you would want to stay.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>Six months in, you were a slow invasion, a gentle claim.<br>
                    Soon it was your shoes by the door—<br>
                    Your books, your coffee, even your name,</p>
                    <p>written into my routines,</p>
                    <p>like you'd always been the refrain.<br>
                    Like my life before you was just a fireplace without a flame.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>And god, you burned so bright, I thought we'd never dim.<br>
                    Thought forever was a given—</p>
                    <p>Thought you could never just end things on a whim.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>But you left when the staying got too real.<br>
                    And every time after when I asked you to feel,</p>
                    <p>instead of conceal—</p>
                    <p>It's <em>"I need space"</em></p>
                    <p>turning into</p>
                    <p><em>"I need time."</em></p>
                    <p>It's <em>"We should talk"</em></p>
                    <p>becoming</p>
                    <p><em>"This isn't fine."</em></p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>It's watching you disappear while you're standing right in front of me.<br>
                    Now you see me,<br>
                    now you don't,</p>
                    <p>now I'm free—</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>Except freedom feels like drowning when you taught me how to breathe.<br>
                    And this just feels like winter,</p>
                    <p>when you were the only summer I could see.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>The last time I saw you, you came to get your things.<br>
                    You stood in my doorway like a stranger making small talk,<br>
                    asked about my job,<br>
                    my mother,</p>
                    <p>Why I wasn't wearing my ring.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>And if I'd fixed that leaky faucet.<br>
                    And I wanted to scream—</p>
                    <p>Who the fuck cares about the faucet when you're already gone?<br>
                    Why are we pretending this is civil,</p>
                    <p>and not devastation with manners on?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>Instead, I said,</p>
                    <p><em>"I'm fine, faucet is fine, yeah, everything is fucking fine."</em></p>
                    <p>And I helped you carry boxes to your car, like my heart wasn't on the line.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>I waved goodbye like we were friends,<br>
                    like this was all according to someone's plan.<br>
                    Like I hadn't spent the last three hours rehearsing how to stand.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>Without falling apart,<br>
                    without begging you to stay,<br>
                    without showing you the wreckage of every word you didn't say.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p><em>So yeah, I think I'm going to miss you for the rest of my life.</em><br>
                    Not the you that left,<br>
                    but the you that stayed.<br>
                    The you that dances in my kitchen, when I have no music left to play.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>The you that listened when my dreams sounded absurd.<br>
                    The you that made me feel seen, without saying a single word.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p><em>So yeah, I think I'm going to miss you for the rest of my life.</em><br>
                    I really miss the story we were writing,</p>
                    <p>before you changed the plot.<br>
                    I'll always miss the ending we were supposed to get,</p>
                    <p>but somehow both forgot.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>You live in a world where I'm a chapter you've closed,<br>
                    while I'm still here, stuck,</p>
                    <p>on the page where you proposed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>More than the future we'd build together,</p>
                    <p>long before you disappeared.<br>
                    Before you left me with the blueprints, and confirmed my every fear.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>I always knew that people leave,</p>
                    <p>and I accept that good things end.<br>
                    But I never thought I'd lose my lover, long before I lost my friend.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stanza">
                    <p>And maybe that's the price I pay,</p>
                    <p>for never learning how to stay.</p>
                    <p>Or when to leave,<br>
                    or how to grieve,<br>
                    or what really happened the day you got lost.<br>
                    Maybe our good was never good enough, when you're scared of what it costs.</p>

                    <p>But I'm scared too—</p>
                    <p>Scared of something borrowed, and something blue.<br>
                    And that the unmistakable hole in my heart, will always be shaped like you.</p>

                    <p>I showed up on a silver platter while I licked you off a knife,<br>
                    so now I know it's true,<br>
                    I'm going to miss you for the rest of my life.</p>

                    <p>So where's the proof that we once mattered?<br>
                    See, I think it all got burned.<br>
                    But maybe that's the lesson that I finally know I've learned.</p>

                    <p>Some people are meant to stay,</p>
                    <p>and some are meant to go,<br>
                    and you were always leaving,</p>
